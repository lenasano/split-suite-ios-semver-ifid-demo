# Split iOS Suite and SemVer (Semantic Version matching) example

### Overview

iOS app that uses Split feature flags to turn on Swift Concurrency.

### _Note_

This sample code is based on the project associated with WWDC21 session [10194: Swift Concurrency: Update a Sample App](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/10194) that demonstrates how to improve your app's performance by refactoring your code to take advantage of asynchronous functions in Swift.

The code was enhanced by Split to demonstrate gradual rollouts with feature flagging. Before refactoring, the original watchOS code was converted to iOS.
